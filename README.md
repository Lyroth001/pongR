This was a mistake :p<br>
Implementation of a simple pong game using ggplot and pygame<br>
**This is not finished**<br>

## Run Instructions

This may work in RStudio, it definetly wont work in posit cloud, as it requires creating a window<br>
This will work in Dataspell. Use that one. Its free for students, or using the early access one. [Jetbrains educational licenses](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)<br>
Graphs load **when the program finishes executing**. This means it effectivly generates a powerpoint of a game of pong to watch back<br>
I am aware this is not ideal

## Features to add

Add movement of R Paddle<br>
Add endstate<br>

=======


## Features might add
Support for more pygame focused mode - actually playable<br>
  Maybe run in pygame as well? Might be actually useable lmfao
