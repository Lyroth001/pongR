This was a mistake :p<br>
Implementation of a simple pong game using ggplot and pygame<br>
**This is not finished**<br>

## Run Instructions

This may work in RStudio, it definetly wont work in posit cloud, as it requires creating a window<br>
This will work in Dataspell. Use that one. Its free for students, or using the early access one<br>
Graphs load **when the program finishes executing**. This means it effecivly generates a powerpoint of a game of pong to watch back<br>
I am aware this is not ideal

## Features to add
Add movement of R Paddle
Add endstate

## Features might add
Support for more pygame focused mode - actually playable
